|   |
|   |   example_nodes.launch    # Launches example_publisher and example_subscriber by importing generic_node.launch
|   |   generic_node.launch     # Launches a node using a variety of configuration options
|   |
|   nodes/                  # Nodes folder holds executable python files which require ROS
|   |
|   |   example_publisher       # Python script (no .py file extension) which starts a ROS node (ExamplePublisher).
|   |   example_subscriber      # Python script (no .py file extension) which starts a ROS node (ExampleSubscriber).
|   |
|   scripts/                # Scripts folder holds executable scripts for non-ROS functionality.
|   |
|   |   template_py_script      # Python script (no .py file extension) which does NOT start a ROS node (but still depends on "src")
